## 2. Get Your API Key

Navigate to the Settings page and generate your API key for programmatic access.

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure! Never commit it to version control or share it publicly.
</Warning>

## 3. Run Your First Query

### Using the Web Interface

Use the SQL editor in the dashboard to run your first query:

```sql
SELECT
  title,
  yes_probability,
  volume_24hr,
  liquidity
FROM polymarket_events
WHERE active = true
ORDER BY volume_24hr DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

<Info>
This query returns the top 10 most traded markets on Polymarket.
</Info>

### Using the API

Make your first API request using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://tremor.sh/api/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "SELECT title, yes_probability FROM polymarket_events LIMIT 5"
  }'
```

<Info>
The query endpoint enforces a rate limit of 30 requests per minute per authenticated user or API key. If you receive a `429` response, pause briefly before retrying.
</Info>

## 4. Explore the Data
