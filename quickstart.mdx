## 3. Run Your First Query

### Using the Web Interface

Use the SQL editor in the dashboard to run your first query:

```sql
SELECT
  title,
  yes_probability,
  volume_24hr,
  liquidity
FROM polymarket_events
WHERE active = true
ORDER BY volume_24hr DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

<Info>
This query returns the top 10 most traded markets on Polymarket.
</Info>

### Using the API

Make your first API request using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.tremor.sh/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "SELECT title, yes_probability FROM polymarket_events LIMIT 5"
  }'
```

### Key Columns

<CodeGroup>

```sql polymarket_events
SELECT
  id,                    -- Unique market identifier
  title,                 -- Market question
  yes_probability,       -- Current yes probability (0-1)
  no_probability,        -- Current no probability (0-1)
  volume_24hr,          -- 24-hour trading volume
  liquidity,            -- Available liquidity
  active,               -- Market status
  sync_timestamp        -- Snapshot timestamp
FROM polymarket_events;
```

```sql kalshi_events
SELECT
  id,                    -- Unique market identifier
  title,                 -- Market question
  yes_probability,       -- Current yes probability (0-1)
  no_probability,        -- Current no probability (0-1)
  volume_24hr,          -- 24-hour trading volume
  active,               -- Market status
  sync_timestamp        -- Snapshot timestamp
FROM kalshi_events;

## 5. Try Advanced Queries

### Find Cross-Platform Arbitrage

```sql
SELECT
  p.title,
  p.yes_probability as polymarket_yes,
  k.yes_probability as kalshi_yes,
  ABS(p.yes_probability - k.yes_probability) as spread,
  p.volume_24hr as poly_volume,
  k.volume_24hr as kalshi_volume
FROM polymarket_events p
INNER JOIN kalshi_events k ON similarity(p.title, k.title) > 0.8
WHERE spread > 0.05
  AND p.active = true
  AND k.active = true
ORDER BY spread DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Track Market Movement Over Time

```sql
SELECT
  sync_timestamp,
  yes_probability,
  volume_24hr,
  liquidity
FROM polymarket_events
WHERE id = 'your-market-id'
  AND sync_timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
ORDER BY sync_timestamp DESC;
```

### Analyze Market Sentiment

```sql
SELECT
  DATE(sync_timestamp) as date,
  AVG(yes_probability) as avg_yes_prob,
  SUM(volume_24hr) as total_volume,
  COUNT(*) as active_markets
FROM polymarket_events
WHERE active = true
  AND sync_timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date DESC;
```
