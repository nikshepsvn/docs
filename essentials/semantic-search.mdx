Semantic search helps you uncover markets related to a topic, even when titles differ. Tremor maintains embeddings for Polymarket and Kalshi using Qwen 8B vectors served through DeepInfra.

## Run a Search

```bash
curl -X POST https://tremor.sh/api/markets/semantic-search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "election markets with high volume",
    "platform": "polymarket",
    "limit": 5,
    "only_active": true
  }'
```

### Request fields

- `query`: Natural-language description of what you need (required)  
- `platform`: Optional filter (`polymarket` or `kalshi`)  
- `limit`: Defaults to 20; capped at 50  
- `min_volume`: Screen out thin markets  
- `only_active`: Return only markets still trading

## Response Primer

Each result includes similarity scores plus live market metrics:

```json
{
  "result_type": "market",
  "platform": "polymarket",
  "title": "Will the EU pass an AI Act by 2025?",
  "category": "Politics",
  "ticker": "ai-act-2025",
  "similarity": 0.81,
  "volume": 123456.78,
  "yes_bid": 0.62,
  "yes_ask": 0.64,
  "status": "active"
}
```

Use the `similarity` score (1.0 is a perfect match) to rank or threshold results.

## Enrich with SQL

Once you have a shortlist, feed market identifiers into SQL queries for deeper analysis:

```sql
SELECT
  m.title,
  m.yes_probability,
  m.volume_24hr,
  m.liquidity
FROM polymarket_events_latest m
WHERE m.id IN {{comma-separated IDs from semantic search}}
ORDER BY m.volume_24hr DESC;
```

<Tip>
Combine with the [Query Recipes](/essentials/query-recipes#semantic-search-booster) snippet to merge vector results and historical snapshots.

## How It Works

- Embeddings are refreshed continuously via the `railway-sync` workers.  
- Tremor stores vectors in ClickHouse tables (`*_market_embeddings`) for sub-200 ms search latency.  
- `cosineDistance` scores return similarity; Tremor converts to `1 - distance` before responding.
