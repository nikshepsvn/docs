Tremor is engineered for accurate, low-latency prediction market data. This guide outlines how we capture, deduplicate, and monitor datasets.

## Snapshot Cadence

- **5-minute intervals** for Polymarket and Kalshi  
- Historical retention is effectively unbounded—snapshots are never purged  
- `_latest` views materialize the newest row per market for quick lookups

<Info>
Use `sync_timestamp` (DateTime64) to time-travel through history or join against `sync_run_history` for ingestion metadata.

## Storage Model

- ClickHouse `MergeTree` tables store canonical history (`polymarket_events`, `kalshi_markets`, etc.)  
- `_latest` tables (`*_events_latest`, `*_markets_latest`) consolidate the freshest snapshot per identifier  
- ReplacingMergeTree ensures deduplication while retaining precise audit trails

## Freshness Guarantees

We monitor sync pipelines with:

- Automatic retries on transient upstream failures  
- Backfill offsets to recover from prolonged outages  
- Health dashboards powered by `/api/sync/status`, `/api/sync/history`, and `/sync/metrics`

## Quality Signals in the Data

- `active`, `closed`, and `archived` flags track lifecycle state  
- Liquidity and volume fields (`volume_24hr`, `liquidity`) are recalculated each sync  
- Metadata JSON in `sync_run_history` captures job-level diagnostics

## Recommended Checks

- **Null audits**: Call [Column Statistics](/api-reference/endpoint/table-stats) to monitor missing data trends.  
- **Staleness alerts**: Notify when `polymarket_events_latest.sync_timestamp` exceeds your freshness budget.  
- **Variance analysis**: Compare successive snapshots to detect sudden price or liquidity swings.
