  AND sync_timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
ORDER BY sync_timestamp;
```

## API Access

### REST API

Programmatic access to Tremor's data endpoints:

```bash
curl -X POST https://tremor.sh/api/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "SELECT * FROM polymarket_events LIMIT 10"
  }'
```

**API Highlights:**
- **Per-key rate limiting** - 30 query executions per minute with burst protection
- **Usage analytics** - Every request is logged, enabling detailed key-level audit trails
- **Rich JSON responses** - Column metadata and row data are returned together
- **Dry-run support** - Validate queries before execution with `/api/query/validate`

<Info>
All endpoints are served from `https://tremor.sh/api`. Authenticate using a Bearer token generated in the Tremor dashboard.
</Info>

### Query Validation & Explain Plans

Guard production workloads by confirming syntax and reviewing the ClickHouse execution plan before running a query:

```bash
curl -X POST https://tremor.sh/api/query/validate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "SELECT count() FROM polymarket_events WHERE sync_timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY"
  }'
```

The response indicates whether the statement is valid and returns the ClickHouse `EXPLAIN` output for further review.

### Semantic Market Search

Discover related markets using vector similarity search across Kalshi and Polymarket:

```bash
curl -X POST https://tremor.sh/api/markets/semantic-search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "election markets with high volume",
    "platform": "polymarket",
    "limit": 5,
    "only_active": true
  }'
```

Results are ranked by semantic relevance and include liquidity, price, and recent volume metrics.

### Sync Monitoring & Metrics

Track ingestion health in real time:

- `GET /api/sync/status` reports the latest snapshot, lag, and recent job history
- `GET /api/sync/history?source=polymarket` returns execution details for recent runs
- `GET /sync/metrics` aggregates long-term sync cadence and duration statistics

These endpoints power the dashboard's Status page and help operators confirm data freshness.

### API Key Management & Usage Tracking

Create and manage credentials directly through the API:

- `POST /api/keys/create` issues scoped API keys (returning the secret once)
- `GET /api/keys/list` lists active keys for the authenticated user
- `DELETE /api/keys/{key_id}` revokes credentials immediately

Admins gain additional visibility via `/api/admin/keys/all` and `/api/admin/keys/{key_id}/usage`, which expose per-endpoint request counts and latency statistics.

### AI Assistant

Natural language to SQL conversion with streaming responses:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask a question">
    Type your question in plain English: "Show me the top 10 markets by volume"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get SQL">
    The AI assistant generates optimized SQL in real time over Server-Sent Events
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute">

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Use `POST /api/assistant/generate/stream` with `mode` set to `query_writer` (default) or `analyst` for commentary plus SQL. This endpoint is rate limited to 20 requests per minute.
</Info>
