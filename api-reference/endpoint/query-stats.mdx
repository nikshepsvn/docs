Review execution metrics for saved queries over the last 30 days. The response aggregates runtime, execution count, and the last execution timestamp for each saved query ID.

<Tip>
To drill into a single saved query, call <a href="/api-reference/endpoint/query-stats-single">GET /api/query/{query_id}/stats</a> with the Supabase query identifier.
